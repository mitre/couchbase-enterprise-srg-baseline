DoD-approved PKI Certification Authorities (CAs) for the establishment of all
encrypted sessions."
  desc  "Only DoD-approved external PKIs have been evaluated to ensure that
they have security controls and identity vetting procedures in place which are
sufficient for DoD systems to rely on the identity asserted in the certificate.
 PKIs lacking sufficient security controls and identity vetting procedures risk
being compromised and issuing certificates that enable adversaries to
impersonate legitimate users.

    The authoritative list of DoD-approved PKIs is published at

    This requirement focuses on communications protection for the DBMS session
rather than for the network packet.
