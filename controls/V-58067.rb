  title "The DBMS must provide the means for individuals in authorized roles to
change the auditing to be performed on all application components, based on all
selectable event criteria within organization-defined time thresholds."
  desc  "If authorized individuals do not have the ability to modify auditing
parameters in response to a changing threat environment, the organization may
not be able to effectively respond, and important forensic information may be
lost.

    This requirement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to
conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain threat
situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to
facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can
establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near
real time, within minutes, or within hours.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    If the DBMS does not provide the ability for users in authorized roles to
reconfigure auditing at any time of the user's choosing, this is a finding.

    If changes in audit configuration cannot take effect until after a certain
time or date, or until some event, such as a server restart, has occurred, and
if that time or event does not meet the requirements specified by the
application owner, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Deploy a DBMS that provides the ability for users in authorized roles to
reconfigure auditing at any time.

    Deploy a DBMS that allows audit configuration changes to take effect within
the timeframe required by the application owner and without involving actions
or events that the application owner rules unacceptable.
