  title "The DBMS must generate audit records when unsuccessful attempts to
access security objects occur."
  desc  "Changes to the security configuration must be tracked.

    This requirement applies to situations where security data is retrieved or
modified via data manipulation operations, as opposed to via specialized
security functionality.

    In an SQL environment, types of access include, but are not necessarily
limited to:
    SELECT
    INSERT
    UPDATE
    DELETE
    EXECUTE

    To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in
addition to the successful ones.

  desc  'check', "
    If the DBMS architecture makes it impossible for any user, even with the
highest privileges, to directly view or directly modify the contents of its
built-in security objects, and if there are no additional, locally-defined
security objects in the database(s), this is not a finding.

    Review DBMS documentation to verify that audit records can be produced when
the system denies or fails to complete attempts to access security objects,
such as tables, views, procedures, and functions, such access to include reads,
creations, modifications and deletions of data, and execution of logic.

    If the DBMS is not capable of this, this is a finding.

    Review the DBMS/database security and audit configurations to verify that
audit records are produced when the system denies attempts to access security
objects, such as tables, views, procedures, and functions, such access to
include reads, creations, modifications and deletions of data, and execution of
logic.

    If they are not produced, this is a finding.

    Review the DBMS/database security and audit configurations to verify that
audit records are produced when other errors prevent attempts to access
security object.

    If they are not produced, this is a finding.

    Deploy a DBMS capable of producing the required audit records when it
denies or fails to complete access to security objects, such as tables, views,
procedures, and functions.

    Configure the DBMS to produce audit records when it denies access to
security objects, such as tables, views, procedures, and functions, such access
to include reads, creations, modifications and deletions of data, and execution
of logic.

    Configure the DBMS to produce audit records when other errors prevent
access to security objects, such as tables, views, procedures, and functions,
such access to include reads, creations, modifications and deletions of data,
and execution of logic.
