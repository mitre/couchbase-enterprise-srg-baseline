  title "The DBMS must be able to generate audit records when successful
accesses to objects occur."
  desc  "Without tracking all or selected types of access to all or selected
objects (tables, views, procedures, functions, etc.), it would be difficult to
establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or
identify those responsible for one.

    In an SQL environment, types of access include, but are not necessarily
limited to:
    SELECT
    INSERT
    UPDATE
    DELETE

    Review DBMS documentation to verify that administrative users can specify
database objects for which access must be audited and can specify which kinds
of access must be audited.

    If the DBMS is not capable of this, this is a finding.

    Review system documentation to determine whether the application owner has
specified database objects (tables, views, procedures, functions, etc.) for
which access must be audited. Review the DBMS/database security and audit
settings to verify that the specified access to the specified objects is
audited.

    If not, this is a finding.

    Deploy a DBMS capable of producing the required audit records when object
access occurs.

    Configure audit settings to create audit records when the specified access
to the specified objects occurs.
