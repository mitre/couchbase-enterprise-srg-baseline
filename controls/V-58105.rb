delete categories of information (e.g., classification levels/security levels)
occur."

trail, unauthorized access to protected data could go undetected.

    To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in

    When enabled on the cluster, Couchbase auditing is capable of logging all
reads, creations, modifications, and deletions.
    Couchbase Server 6.5.0 and earlier -
      As root or a sudo user, verify that the \"audit.log\" file exists in the
var/lib/couchbase/logs directory of the Couchbase application home (example:
/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs) and is populated with data captured.
      Review the audit.log file. If it does not exist or not populated with
data captured, this is a finding.
    Couchbase Server Version 6.5.1 and later -
      As the Full Admin, verify that auditing is enabled by executing the
following command:
       $ couchbase-cli setting-audit -c <host>:<port> -u <Full Admin> -p
<Password> --get-settings
      Review the output of the command. If \"Audit enabled\" is not set to
\"true\", this is finding.
