It takes advantage\nof the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages,\nincluding dialects of SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in\nwhich SQL statements are being processed, either from inside knowledge or by\nobserving system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker\nidentifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code\n(which may be within the database or separate from it) and executed\ndynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert the\nintent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to\ndata, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n\n    The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic\nexecution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be\nutilized otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose\nstrings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures\nand functions (and triggers).\n\n    When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the\nfollowing, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at\nthe database level, in the stored procedures:\n    -- Allow strings as input only when necessary.\n    -- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept\ninvalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about\nwhether this could be subverted.\n    -- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\n    -- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs,\nangle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.\n    -- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them.
