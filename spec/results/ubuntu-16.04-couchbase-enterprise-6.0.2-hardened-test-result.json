Managing\n  accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to\n  problems with consistency and synchronization.\n\n  A comprehensive application account management process that includes\n  automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are\n  consistently and promptly addressed.\n\n  Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action\n  on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by\n  disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple\n  servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or\n  role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access\n  authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and\n  administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for\n  example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users\n  are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account\n  usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system\n  account usage.\n\n  Couchbase must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level\n  account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the\n  organization's current account policy.\n\n  Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed\n  together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated\n  account management requirements.\n  \"\n  desc  \"check\", \"\n  If all accounts are authenticated by the organization-level\n  authentication/access mechanism and not by Couchbase, this is not a finding.\n  \n  If there are any accounts managed by Couchbase, review the system\n  documentation for justification and approval of these accounts.\n\n  As the Full Admin, list all RBAC users in each cluster with the following\n  command:\n    $ couchbase-cli user-manage -u <Full Admin> -p <Password> --cluster\n    <host>:<port> --list\n\n  If any Couchbase-managed accounts exist that are not documented and\n  approved, this is a finding.\n  \"\n  desc  \"fix\", \"\n  Integrate Couchbase security with an organization-level\n  authentication/access mechanism providing account management for all users,\n  groups, roles, and any other principals.\n  For each Couchbase-managed account that is not documented and approved,\n  either transfer it to management by the external mechanism, or document the\n  need for it and obtain approval, as appropriate.\n  \n  To remove undocumented accounts, execute the following command:\n    $ couchbase-cli user-manage -u <Full Admin> -p <Password> --cluster\n    <host>:<port> --set --delete --rbac-username <username> --auth-domain <domain>\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag \"severity\": \"medium\"\n  tag \"gtitle\": \"SRG-APP-000023-DB-000001\"\n  tag \"gid\": \"V-32192\"\n  tag \"rid\": \"SV-42509r3_rule\"\n  tag \"stig_id\": \"SRG-APP-000023-DB-000001\"\n  tag \"fix_id\": \"F-36116r2_fix\"\n  tag \"cci\": [\"CCI-000015\"]\n  tag \"nist\": [\"AC-2 (1)\", \"Rev_4\"]\n\n  if input('cb_auth_domain') == \"external\"\n    domain_list = []\n    json_output = command(\"couchbase-cli user-manage -u #{input('cb_full_admin')} -p #{input('cb_full_admin_password')} --cluster #{input('cb_cluster_host')}:#{input('cb_cluster_port')} --list | grep 'domain'\").stdout.split(\"\\n\")\n    json_output.each do |output|\n      domain = command(\"echo '#{output}' | awk -F '\\\"' '{print $4}'\").stdout.strip\n      domain_list.push(domain)\n    end\n    domain_list.each do |domain|\n      describe \"All accounts are authenticated by the organization-level authentication/access \n      mechanism and not by Couchbase, therefore this is not a finding.

Transactions must be\nsuccessfully completed or rolled back.\n\n    In general, security mechanisms should be designed so that a failure will\nfollow the same execution path as disallowing the operation. For example,\napplication security methods, such as isAuthorized(), isAuthenticated(), and\nvalidate(), should all return false if there is an exception during processing.\nIf security controls can throw exceptions, they must be very clear about\nexactly what that condition means.\n\n    Abort refers to stopping a program or function before it has finished\nnaturally.
